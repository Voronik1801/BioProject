# Prediction of survival time of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on hydrogen bond graphs
This work is graduate work. I've been doing it for two years, the result and process present in this [Notebook](https://github.com/Voronik1801/BioProject/blob/master/Prediction%20Survival%20Time.ipynb)
# Purpose and objectives
- Development of a method for calculating the characteristics of the graph of hydrogen bonds, which will allow selecting optimal sets of characteristics and optimal calculation methods that give the best prediction result. 

- Construction and investigation of regression models linking the characteristics of the graph of hydrogen bonds associated with ALS with the survival of patients who are carriers of these mutations. Prediction of survival of patients with mutations in SOD1.

- Analysis of the results of the constructed regression model and identification of the sites of the SOD1 enzyme that affect life expectancy.
